# C-Projects-
# ðŸš€ C++ Projects Repository  

Welcome to my **C++ Projects** repository! This is a collection of various C++ projects that I am working on as I learn and improve my coding skills. The projects range from beginner-friendly programs to more advanced applications covering **data structures, algorithms, system programming, and problem-solving.**  

## ðŸ“Œ About the Repository  

This repository contains:  
- ðŸ›  **Basic C++ Programs** â€“ Fundamental concepts, syntax, and simple programs.  
- ðŸ”¢ **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** â€“ Implementations of common DSA problems in C++.  
- ðŸŽ® **Mini Projects** â€“ Small-scale applications showcasing OOP, file handling, and other concepts.  
- ðŸ“‚ **System Programming** â€“ Projects exploring system calls, memory management, and OS concepts.  
- ðŸ¤– **Advanced Projects** â€“ Future additions in AI/ML using C++ and performance optimizations.  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started  

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)  
- **Code Editor** (VS Code, CLion, CodeBlocks, etc.)  
- **Git** (optional, for version control)  

### **How to Run a Project**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-projects.git
2. Navigate to the desired project folder:
   ```bash
   cd cpp-projects/project-name
4. Compile and run the C++ file:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output  
   ./output
